# Changelog

All notable changes to NEXT HMI are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While the project is pre-1.0, minor versions may include breaking changes; these
are always called out under a **Changed** or **Removed** heading.

## [Unreleased]

Targeted as **1.0.0** — the first public release. Everything below ships in the
initial open-source build. At tag time this heading becomes `[1.0.0] - <date>`.

### Added

- **Browser-based HMI runtime.** Self-hosted operator panels that run in any
  modern browser — no per-seat client install. Connects to PLCs over OPC-UA.
- **Manager + per-project instance model.** A single manager front door
  supervises independent project instances behind a reverse proxy, each with its
  own runtime state and lifecycle.
- **In-browser page editor.** Build and lay out dashboards from the runtime
  itself — widgets, bindings, and pages are authored without leaving the app.
- **Widget system.** Built-in widget library plus a custom-widget SDK with a
  build pipeline, authoring rules, and a schema contract for third-party widgets.
- **Property value model.** Typed property values with `$`-wrapped sources
  (`$var`, and friends), an OPC-UA type-collapse layer, and consistent
  resolution/coercion across components.
- **OPC-UA connectivity.** Client pool with a self-signed client certificate
  generated on first secured connect; secure-config datasources.
- **Alarms, recipes, and historian.** Alarm handling, recipe management, and
  historical data — all in the single open-source build, with no feature paywall.
- **Widget visibility model.** Per-widget `visible`/`interactable` controls
  driven by a `$userGroups` source.
- **Theming.** Theme token catalog and pipeline with `hmi-*` / `cfg-*`
  conventions and shared UI primitives; unset values fall through to theme
  tokens, set values override.
- **WebSocket protocol.** `/ws` runtime channel with a defined handshake,
  server/client message set, async-action result correlation, and
  `config_changed` propagation.
- **Manager-to-manager LAN transfer.** Peer transfer of projects between
  managers on a local network, with a trust model and collision policies.
- **REST API** for the manager and project-instance apps.
- **MCP server** exposing a workspace tool catalog with per-project gating.
- **Runtime performance tooling.** Performance HUD (Ctrl+Alt+P), list windowing,
  and granular per-variable subscriptions.
- **HMI boot screen**, carrying the product logo, version, load progress and the
  AGPL-3.0 attribution notice on every load of the runtime, held for a minimum
  of two seconds. The notice is edition-bound — no project setting hides it; the
  commercial build drops it and adds a `shell.bootLogo` setting for white-label
  branding, which the open-source build ignores. Neither is a runtime licence
  check.
- **Deployment targets.** Multi-arch Docker image (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64)
  published to GHCR, and portable macOS / Windows binaries — all attached to
  each tagged release by CI.
- **Documentation set** covering architecture, data formats, the value model,
  the WebSocket protocol, theming, custom widgets, the REST API, peer transfer,
  MCP, deployment, and a threat model.

### Security

- No CORS middleware ships by design; the runtime is same-origin and intended to
  sit behind a reverse proxy on an OT network or VPN, never on the public
  Internet. See [SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md) and the threat model in
  `docs/dev/operations/deploy.md`.
- Session cookies set the `Secure` flag when served over HTTPS.
- The page/widget editor is a privileged, code-execution-capable role
  (server-side file writes and arbitrary browser JS); documented in
  `docs/dev/reference/custom-widgets.md`.

### Licensing

- Released under **AGPL-3.0**. See [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md),
  [LICENSE](LICENSE), and [COMMERCIAL.md](COMMERCIAL.md).
- The `asyncua` (LGPL-3.0) and `zeroconf` (LGPL-2.1) runtime dependencies are
  shipped loose (replaceable) in binary builds, with the LGPL texts and a
  written source offer bundled alongside.
